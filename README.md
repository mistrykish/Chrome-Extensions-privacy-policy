# Privacy Policy for the To-do List Chrome Extension

## Information Collection and Use

The To-do List Chrome Extension does not collect any personally identifiable information. It utilizes the browser's local storage to store and manage todo list items provided by the user.

## Data Storage and Usage

The Extension stores all todo list data locally within the user's browser using the local storage functionality provided by the Chrome browser. This means that all data entered into the Extension, including todo items, is stored exclusively on the user's device and is not transmitted to any external servers or third parties.

## Information Security

I take reasonable measures to secure the data stored by the Extension on the user's device. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is completely secure. While I strive to protect your information, I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the updated Privacy Policy on the Extension. It is advisable to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any substantial changes (excludes potential typos).
